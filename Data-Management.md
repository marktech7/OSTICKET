##Ticket data
These fields are included on each new ticket that is created by client or staff; regardless of Help Topic selected. Ticket meta-data, including creation date and other preconfigured information, will appear on the ticket header when viewing a ticket. 

##End user data
This is the information associated with users in your help desk. This information will not be visible along the ticket header- only within the userâ€™s profile if you click on their name on the ticket header. You can also view and edit this information in the User Directory. 

##Organization data
Information associated with Organizations created in the help desk can be located in this form. Currently the only require field is the name of the organization. These fields will appear only when creating a new ticket or editing the information of an Organization. 

##Custom data
Any additional configured fields that are added to a Custom Form or included in the built-in forms is considered custom data. 

###Custom forms and fields
Custom Forms allow you to create a variety of fields; all customizable by you. Fields can be configured with their visibility as required by you for both end users and agents. These Custom Forms can then be added to Help Topics to help improve the workflow by capturing any required information from the user when submitting a ticket.

##Custom lists
These can be created for use as a custom field on a built-in or custom form. List items can be sorted alphabetically, reverse alphabetically or manually. 

###List properties
Each item on a custom list can have specific properties configured and associated with them yet the details of the properties may be unique for each item. List Properties can be utilized in Ticket Filter rules to determine specific actions when met. Information contained in the configured properties can be utilized through variables in canned responses and email templates. 

##Attachments and files
Attachments can be used in agent or canned responses to clients to help answer the ticket, as part of a knowledge base article available to both agents and end users. Attachments can be enabled for end users as they submit tickets including the maximum file size per attachment and acceptable file types.
