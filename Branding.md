##Logo and company data
The help desk can be branded to your company by adding a company logo to the site pages as well as email templates for Auto responses. The data input in to the company data form will be utilized in naming the help desk and through variables in the auto responses sent to the end users. Numerous logos can be uploaded to the help desk but be sure to select the logo to be seen on the Landing, Thank You & Offline pages. Only one logo can be visible at a time on all Site Pages. 

##Email templates
Email alerts and auto-responses are very important for communication with the agents and end users in relation to your help desk. There is a default set of Email Templates, which messages can be edited as needed. The email templates contain an HTML/Rich Text tool bar that allows photo uploads, text mark up as well as links and videos to be embedded.  Each department in the help desk can have its own set of cloned and edited email Template sets.

##Custom pages
There are four page types that can be edited allowing you to create numerous site pages for end users. 

The Landing page is the first view an end user will see when they access the Client Portal. It is where you welcome your user, as well as allow them to create a ticket and check the status of tickets.

The Offline pages appears to end users when the help desk is disabled.

The Thank You page appears once the end user has created and submitted a ticket from the client portal.

Other pages can be used as a simple content management system (CMS)
