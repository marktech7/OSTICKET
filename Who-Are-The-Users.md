# End Users

The help desk is used to facilitate communicate between the support Agents and the End Users. Think of a End User as someone who requires assistance or has a question, and seeks an answer through your help desk, through creating a ticket via your client portal, by sending in an email, or by any other channel in your help desk.

Users are identified by their unique email address.

# Collaborators

A Collaborator is an End User, in addition to the ticket owner, who is included on responses and communication in a ticket. Collaborators can be added or removed at any time in the life cycle of a ticket. Collaborators can respond in and contribute to the issue of the ticket.

# Agents

An agent is a member of your staff that has the ability to login to your help desk system and view, manage, and correspond with End Users on tickets. Tickets may be assigned to a specific agent or team of agents. Your agents will interact directly with your ticket owners as needed to solve their support issues. Agentsâ€™ permissions are determined by their group, as granted by administrators.
