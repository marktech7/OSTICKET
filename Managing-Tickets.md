One of the primary goals of a ticketing system is to help manage End User inquiries, making them easier to find, resolve, and correlate.

# Ticket Queues

osTicket organizes lists of tickets into Queues, which collate and organize tickets in smaller buckets.

## Open Tickets

Open tickets which are awaiting a response from an Agent are placed in the Open queue.

## Answered Tickets

Open tickets which have been responded to by an Agent will be placed in the Answered queue. Tickets here represent tickets which are awaiting a response from the End User. When a new Message is posted by an End User (either the Owner or a Collaborator), the ticket will return to the Open queue.

## My Tickets

My Tickets comprises a list of open tickets which are assigned to you as an Agent. That is, the tickets which are assigned directly to you, not a team on which you participate.

## Overdue Tickets

Tickets can have a configured due date and also can have an associated Service Level Agreement (SLA), which will create an automatic due date. When the due date passes, a ticket is marked overdue, an alert is sent to relevant Agents, and the ticket will be shown in the Overdue ticket queue.

## Closed Tickets

Tickets in your Closed queue contain tickets that have been marked resolved or closed. If a closed ticket is reopened, it will return to the open queue.

# Searching

The ticket queue pages include a basic search box which can search for tickets by the ticket number as well as the end user name and email address. An advanced search feature is available to search for tickets based on much more flexible criteria including

  * Keywords
  * Current status
  * Current assignee
  * Current help topic or department
  * Create date range
  * Data in custom fields
