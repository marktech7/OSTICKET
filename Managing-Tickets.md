One of the primary goals of a ticketing system is to help manage End User inquiries, making them easier to find, resolve, and correlate.

# Ticket Queues

osTicket organizes lists of tickets into Queues, which collate and organize tickets in smaller buckets.

## Open Tickets

## Answered Tickets

## My Tickets

My Tickets comprises a list of open tickets which are assigned to you as an Agent. That is, the tickets which are assigned directly to you, not a team on which you participate.

## Overdue Tickets

Tickets can have a configured due date and also can have an associated Service Level Agreement (SLA), which will create an automatic due date. When the due date passes, a ticket is marked overdue, an alert is sent to relevant Agents, and the ticket will be shown in the Overdue ticket queue.
