osTicket has several mechanisms to govern access to support tickets.

# Agents

## Primary Department

Agents can be assigned to a one Department, called their Primary Department. This provides access to the tickets that primarily concern the Agents.

## Extended Access Groups

Groups provide two functions for associated Agents. They serve as a list of abilities or permissions for the associated Agents, and they provide associated Agents access to Departments outside their primary Department. You can create as many groups as needed — even if they have the same permissions — to ensure Agents have access to the tickets necessary to perform their job function.

## Assignment

Tickets can be assigned to an individual Agent as well as a Team. That is, a ticket can be assigned to both an individual Agent as well as a Team. This is useful if a certain member of the assigned Team is working on the ticket.

### Limited Access Agents

Agents can be optionally configured to have access only to the tickets to which they are directly assigned — either via direct individual assignment or via team assignment. Such agents do not have access to all the tickets which would otherwise be visible to them based on their assigned primary Department and Group.
