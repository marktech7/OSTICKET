# The Client Portal
End User's can go to your help desk client portal and raise a support request. This will require them to fill in details for new tickets as configured in your help desk. The urls to your client portal and your staff control panel are configured when you create your help desk. These can be changed at any time, but usually require separate configuration of your HTTP server.

# Email
osTicket allows you to setup unlimited number of email addresses to handle all your company's mail accounts and email communication. Incoming emails are converted to support tickets allowing you to easily manage, organize and archive all emailed support requests in one place.

# API
The API allows for creating tickets from sources outside osTicket. For instance, if your web site currently has a "Contact Us" form, you can link the results of those submissions to create tickets in your help desk, allowing your Agents to respond directly to your customers and clients in one place.

# Agents
Agents performing phone support, for instance, can create tickets on behalf on End Users. This allows all your Agents access to End User information details and phone support details.
